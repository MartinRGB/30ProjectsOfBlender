I lacked knowledge of 3D Design.For better CG Coding(Unity/Three.js),I decide to start learning Blender.

By learning the theory behind these effect,I can understand how to code interactive effect.

What I think about 3D Programming:

- I think I should use a texture noise for distorting the plane's vertex

- then set the model's normal,set environment map texture as uniform for calculating

- try to customize drawing in shader.

- better not use OPENGL's default light,cuz detail is not good.
